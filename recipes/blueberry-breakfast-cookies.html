            <li>&frac13; cup toasted choped walnuts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Place 1 3/4 cups of the oats in a blender or food processor. Blend or process to a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Beat butter with an electric mixer in a bowl for 30 seconds. Beat in peanut butter and maple syrup until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla just until combined.</li>
            <li>Combine oat flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Add oat flour mixture to peanut butter mixture and beat in until combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in remaining 1 cup oats, blueberries, and walnuts.</li>
            <li>Drop generous 1/4 cup portions of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, about 6 cookies per sheet, and lightly flatten. Bake until browned, about 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer to wire racks to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
